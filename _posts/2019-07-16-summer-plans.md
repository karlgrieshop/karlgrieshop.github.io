I’ll be giving the [John Maynard Smith Prize](https://eseb.org/prizes-funding/john-maynard-smith-prize/) lecture at the [ESEB meeting](https://eseb2019.fi/) in Turku, Finland this August. Hope to see you there!

We’ll be visiting family in France beforehand, and friends in Uppsala afterward (Aug. 25-27).
