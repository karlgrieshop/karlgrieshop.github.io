Here's my John Maynard Smith prize lecture to ~1000 people [@ESEB2019](https://twitter.com/ESEB2019): [Watch on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHKXt-tyedQ&feature=youtu.be&t=3913)  
Managed to hide my trembling interior behind my bearded exterior for the most part. Thanks [@FishConGen](https://twitter.com/FishConGen) for giving me a question despite going over time. And thanks to these people and funding bodiesâ€¦
