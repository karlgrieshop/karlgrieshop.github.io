**Postdoc opportunities**  
If you are interested in joining the lab as a postdoc, then please email me. A number of externally funded schemes are available for all levels of experience, and I am happy to talk about possible projects that combine your and our research interests and assist you with preparing an application.

<span id="phd"></span>
**PhD studentships**  
We are always looking for clever and motivated PhD students. At UEA, studentships are available through the [NERC Aries DTP](https://www.aries-dtp.ac.uk/) and [BBSRC NRP DTP](https://biodtp.norwichresearchpark.ac.uk/). We usually offer projects through both, but itâ€™s a good idea to email me before applying. Applications for both programmes open in the autumn, with deadlines in December or January.

<span id="masters"></span>
**Master's**  
We're always keen to supervise master's research dissertations. There are three types of master's available at UEA: postgraduate research ([PGR](https://www.uea.ac.uk/course/phd-doctorate/postgraduate-research-in-biological-sciences)), postgraduate taught ([PGT](https://www.uea.ac.uk/search/courses?primaryCategory%5B0%5D=Postgraduate&department%5B0%5D=Biological%20Sciences)), and the [integrated BSc+MSci](https://www.uea.ac.uk/course/undergraduate/msci-biological-sciences).  

The PGR ([MSc Res](https://www.uea.ac.uk/research/research-with-us/postgraduate-research/postgraduate-qualifications-explained/masters-by-research)) is a year-long research period ("Period of Study") followed by a year-long writing-up period (Period of Registration) - it's basically the first year of a PhD, research-focused, with no required taught modules. Email me if interested.  

The PGT (MSc) features several different year-long programs that include taught modules and a research dissertation - the relevant tracks for the Grieshop Lab would be [MSc Evolution and Genomics](https://www.uea.ac.uk/course/postgraduate/msc-evolution-and-genomics), [MSc Data Science for Biology](https://www.uea.ac.uk/course/postgraduate/msc-data-science-for-biology), [MSc Animal Behaviour](https://www.uea.ac.uk/course/postgraduate/msc-animal-behaviour), or the [MSc Biology of Ageing and Lifelong Health](https://www.uea.ac.uk/course/postgraduate/msc-biology-of-ageing-and-lifelong-health).  
  
Here's some more info on the [integrated BSc+MSci](https://www.uea.ac.uk/course/undergraduate/msci-biological-sciences#course_modules).

<span id="undergraduate"></span>
**Undergraduate**  
We supervise a range of undergraduate research projects in the areas of evolutionary biology, genomics, transcriptomics, and theory - using programming languages such as Bash, R, and Python.
