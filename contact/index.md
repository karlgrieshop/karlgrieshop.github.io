Postdoc opportunities  
If you are interested in joining the lab as a postdoc, then please email me. A number of externally funded schemes are available for all levels of experience, and I am happy to talk about possible projects that combine your and our research interests and assist you with preparing an application.

PhD studentships  
We are always looking for clever and motivated PhD students. At UEA, studentships are available through the [NERC Aries DTP](https://www.aries-dtp.ac.uk/) and [BBSRC NRP DTP](https://biodtp.norwichresearchpark.ac.uk/). We usually offer projects through both, but itâ€™s a good idea to email me before applying. Applications for both programmes open in the autumn, with deadlines in December or January.

Master's  
We're always keen to supervise master's research dissertations. There are three types of master's available at UEA: postgraduate research ([PGR](https://www.uea.ac.uk/course/phd-doctorate/postgraduate-research-in-biological-sciences)), postgraduate taught ([PGT](https://www.uea.ac.uk/search/courses?primaryCategory%5B0%5D=Postgraduate&department%5B0%5D=Biological%20Sciences)), and the [integrated BSc+MSci](https://www.uea.ac.uk/course/undergraduate/msci-biological-sciences).  
The PGR ([MSc Res](https://www.uea.ac.uk/research/research-with-us/postgraduate-research/postgraduate-qualifications-explained/masters-by-research)) is a year-long research period ("Period of Study") followed by a year-long writing-up period (Period of Registration) - it's basically the first year of a PhD, research-focused, with no required taught modules. Email me if interested.  
The PGT (MSc) features several different year-long programs that include taught modules and a research dissertation - the relevant tracks for the Grieshop Lab would be [MSc Evolution and Genomics](https://www.uea.ac.uk/course/postgraduate/msc-evolution-and-genomics), [MSc Data Science for Biology](https://www.uea.ac.uk/course/postgraduate/msc-data-science-for-biology), [MSc Animal Behaviour](https://www.uea.ac.uk/course/postgraduate/msc-animal-behaviour), or the [MSc Biology of Ageing and Lifelong Health](https://www.uea.ac.uk/course/postgraduate/msc-biology-of-ageing-and-lifelong-health).  
[The integrated BSc+MSci](https://www.uea.ac.uk/course/undergraduate/msci-biological-sciences)  
More info on the [integrated BSc+MSci](https://www.uea.ac.uk/course/undergraduate/msci-biological-sciences#course_modules).

Undergraduate  
We supervise a range of undergraduate research projects in the areas of evolutionary biology, genomics, transcriptomics, and theory - using programming languages such as Bash, R, and Python.
